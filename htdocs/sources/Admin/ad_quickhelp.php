											  			  <b>Warning!</b>
											  			  <br />
											  			  Invision Power Board recognises the search engine spiders and crawlers by their user_agent. Please keep in mind
											  			  that it's not impossible to fake this and a malicious user could pose as a harmless search engine spider.
											  			  <br />This is not a problem as by default the spider will have guest permissions, but it's something that
											  			  you should keep in mind when allowing permissions.
											  			  <br /><br />Also keep in mind that most search engines do NOT search dynamically generated website for fear
											  			  of crashing the server with the constant reading of topics.
